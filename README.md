# Wordle Best First Word Project

### Summary
The **Worldle Best First Word** project seeks to determine the best first word to play in a single game of [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html). This project started with the `word_bank.txt` file that includes all of the words in the English dictionary. The `best_first_word.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook analyzes all of the 5-letter-long English words and determines which characters occur most frequently in each position.

##### Category 4: Best Practices
- The program should utilize a virtual environment and document library dependencies in a requirements.txt file.
##### *"STRETCH"* Feature List
